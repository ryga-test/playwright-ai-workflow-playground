## Locator Priority

Per constitutional Principle II, locators follow this priority order:

1. **getByRole** — accessible, stable, framework-agnostic (preferred)
2. **getByTestId** — stable when `data-testid` attributes exist
3. **getByLabel** — good for form inputs with associated `<label>` elements
4. **getByPlaceholder** — usable, less stable than labels
5. **getByText** — fragile to content changes
6. **CSS / XPath** — last resort, brittle, document with justification

---

## Human-Curated

- Prefer accessible role/label locators where the public site exposes stable accessible names.
- Document any CSS/XPath fallback with the reason it was needed.
